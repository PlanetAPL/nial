<H3>Preamble</H3>
<p> This is a version of the <I> artistic</I> licence used by the Perl community.
It has been modified slightly to suit the needs of the Nial Open Source Project.
<P>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package 
may be copied, such that Nial Systems can maintain some semblance of 
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of 
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less 
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. </P>
<H3>Definitions</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright 
  Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual 
  modification. </P>
  <P>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or 
  has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as 
  specified below. </P>
  <P>"Copyright Holder" is NIAL Systems Limited. </P>
  <P>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this 
  Package. </P>
  <P>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media 
  cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not 
  be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
  community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) </P>
  <P>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though 
  there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients 
  of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
  <P>
  <LI>You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
  Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
  from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
  such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when 
  you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <OL type=a>
    <LI>place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such 
    as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
    modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. 
    <LI>use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 
    <LI>rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
    standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
    manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it 
    differs from the Standard Version. 
    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or 
  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <OL type=a>
    <LI>distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to 
    get the Standard Version. 
    <LI>accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
    Package with your modifications. 
    <LI>give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document 
    the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions 
    on where to get the Standard Version. 
    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
  Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You 
  may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this 
  Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a 
  larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not 
  advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's 
  interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be 
  construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard 
  Version of the interpreter is so embedded. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output 
  from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the 
  copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be 
  sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or 
  library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or 
  "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of 
  such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor 
  shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you 
  do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this 
  Package. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) 
  supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines 
  and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered 
  part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, 
  provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would 
  cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always 
  permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no 
  overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end 
  user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a 
  distribution of this Package. 
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 

  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
  WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
  MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
