# a test to show speed of computation in the face of fragmentation.
  Run 
        timeit test 1000 10000
There should be no delay between the 4th and 5th outputs of status
and time. The old memory allocator had a significant delay there.

test is OP M N { 
    Z := floor (M times random n);
    write status; write time;
    X gets EACH string Z;
    write status; write time;
    Y gets cull X;
    write status; write time;
    X gets 5;
    write status; write time;
    EACH string Z;
    write status; write time;
    Y gets 10;
    write status; write time;
}
