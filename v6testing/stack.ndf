#This file tests the depth of Nial recursions that are possible
in a given version. There are two tests:
recur_n 	recurs until n is reached.
deeprecur   recurs until the system fails or recursion is stopped.

recur_n is op i n {
  IF i=n THEN 
     n
  ELSE
     recur_n [i + 1,n]
  ENDIF
}

deeprecur is op i { write i; deeprecur (i + 1) }
